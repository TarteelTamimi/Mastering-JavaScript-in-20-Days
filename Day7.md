- [x] Summarize what I learned

## Topics
### ✍️Topic 1 -> asynchronuous coding
`console.log('Hello')` is vary quick, and javaScript can usually run straight through our program "synchronously" (e.g. one thing at a time), so we need way in javaScropt that allows us to do multiple taskes together witch called **asynchronous**. 
#### fetching data
`fetch()` is a built-in function witch let us use javaScript to load data from APIs, ex. `fetch('https://getemoji.com/');`, and it returns a **promise**.
> note -> JSON stands for javaScript object notation.
#### promise
promises promise us that it will give us the data we want, but it does not hava it yet.
- promises can be in three states:
1. pending: still waiting for the value.
2. fulfilled (resolved): got the value successfully.
3. rejected: could not get the value.
