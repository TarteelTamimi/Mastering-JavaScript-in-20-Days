# ⭐️Day Two (JUL 4 2023)

## To-Do List for today
- [x] Watch 90-minutes of courses-Frontend Masters
- [x] Solve Challenges-Freecodecamp
- [x] Solve one problem-Codewars
- [x] Summarize what I learned

## Topics
### ✍️Topic 1 -> Valuse and Data Types
information (data) in javaScript can be of diffrent types:
- strings: it can be between double quotes `" "`, single quotes `' '` or backticks.
- numbers: it can be positive or negative integers, flaoting numbers and also infinity.
- boolean: true or false.
- undefined: accidental nothing & its type is undefined.
- null: deliberate nothing & its type is object.
- others --we will learn about it later--

> #### notes
> - `typeof` tells us the type of value ex. `typeof true  //boolean`
> - 4 != "4"
> - data types in javaScript can be primitive (ex. string, number) or object (ex. document)

### ✍️Topic 2 -> strings 
strings made of small units called characters
> in string, characters are in specific order, each gets a number, starting at 0
